ABSTRACT =
$(P
D is advertised as a safe and fast systems programming language. “Fast code,
fast." is the mantra of the D community. But how fast it really is and how suitable for
systems programming? We thought to investigate this by porting a Linux kernel driver
to D, documenting the process, and assessing the results. The talk will delve into the
details of integrating a D kernel module with the C-written kernel, discuss the
difficulties encountered, and present the performance and safety benchmarks
obtained. If you ever wondered if writing a Linux driver in D would be a good idea and
how to do that, then this talk could be a good starting point for you.

$(P $(B $(U Description)))

$(P
The talk aims to present the steps we took to port a Linux device driver to D,
namely virtio_net. We will comment the main difficulties we encountered and how we
overcame them, the safety improvements we achieved using features implemented in
the D language, and the performance and safety benchmarks obtained. There will be
five big topics discussed:
    $(T ul,,
        $(LI linking a D object file with the other Linux kernel objects)
        $(LI porting C code to D: issues, design decisions and shortcomings)
        $(LI a better C: the features we used to improve the code’s safety and how we did that)
        $(LI assessing the D-written driver’s behaviour: benchmarks and results)
        $(LI conclusions)
    )
)

$(P
The talk offers a starting point and propose a methodology for those who want to
port or implement a Linux driver in D and, in the end, reflects on how suited is D for
kernel programming, how fast it is in such an environment, and what improvements it
brings.

$(P $(B $(U Current Status)))

$(P
By the end of March, the porting of the virtio_net driver will be done. From that
point on, we will begin “D-ifying” the obtained code and benchmark it. Our estimate is
that by the time of the conference everything will be ready. Even if something
unexpected occurs and delays the project schedule, we think that the discoveries we have
made so far should be interesting enough for the D community.

BIO =
$(P Alexandru Militaru is a student in his final year of bachelor’s studies and an
undergraduate teaching assistant at University "Politehnica" of Bucharest. He is
passionate about operating systems and compilers. In his bachelor thesis project, he
uses the D programming language to strengthen the security of Linux kernel modules.
