$(P
The AGM provides an opportunity to participate in the determination of the Foundation's vision, provides a formal setting to discuss and resolve longstanding issues and take advantage of face-to-face communication to accelerate organizational processes. Topics up for discussion include: DIPs; Pull requests; Internal implementation issues; General issues and topics of interest; Infrastructure, libraries and progress reports; bug squashing prioritization, and longer-term goals and vision for the DLF. The proceeds of the discussions will help focus and set the stage for the Hackathon.

$(P
This is the first AGM we've hosted at DConf. It was proposed by Nicholas Wilson and is expected to last an-hour-and-a-half, but it could go longer. The morning session of the Hackathon will begin immediately following the AGM.
