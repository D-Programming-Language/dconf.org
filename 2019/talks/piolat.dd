ABSTRACT =
$(P
intel-intrinsics is a D SIMD library that reuses existing Intel syntax for SIMD intrinsics, $(LINK2 https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#techs=MMX$(COMMA)SSE$(COMMA)SSE2 and associated documentation).
)

$(P
Besides familiarity, we'll discuss the measurable improvements you may expect today from your usage of intel-intrinsics, versus alternatives, with examples of real production code.
)

$(P
What could possibly be more boring than that?
)

$(P
It turns out intel-intrinsics is different from equivalents in other languages. Our vision is to decorrelate semantics and codegen completely to harness the power of the backend.

BIO =
$(P Guillaume Piolat worked as a professional complainer in various segments of the software industry: mostly signal processing.    Struck by baldness early, he is now a purveyor of audio effects in the pro audio market, as Auburn Sounds. Guillaume created $(LINK2 https://p0nce.github.io/d-idioms/, "D-idioms"), a blog to bring awareness on the most mundane points of the language. You will likely see him rant about complexity on the D forums.
