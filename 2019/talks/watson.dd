ABSTRACT =
$(P
Design by introspection and compile-time function evaluation is fun and exciting. Especially for a performance-focused programmer that likes the idea of running as much code as possible offline. But itâ€™s also something of a wild-west. There are idioms for standard metaprogramming approaches. But what else is the language capable of? Join Ethan as he discovers just how far he can push D with an eye on making a code base easily maintainable and highly efficient$(MDASH)two goals that have generally been considered mutually exclusive.

This session also aims to give a person new to this kind of programming an easy road into the concepts and methods used.

BIO =
$(P Fourth time lucky? Ethan Watson is a bit of a vet when it comes to D Conf, having presented at the three previous events. An unhealthy fascination with squirrels aside, his talks are regarded for being information-rich and entertaining at the same time$(MDASH)thanks to combining 16 years of experience as a programmer in the video games industry with his experience in amateur stand-up comedy. He is currently in the process of setting up a middleware studio and working at another Finnish game studio (Housemarque) at the same time.
