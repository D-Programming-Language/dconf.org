$(T h1,, Nightly Gathering Spot)
$(P Just around the corner from the venue is the $(LINK2 https://www.theprincearthurpub.co.uk/, Prince Arthur Pub). This is our official gathering spot in the evenings. We've booked a room for May 8, 9, and 10. Part of the fun of DConf is talking face-to-face with the other attendees. This backstreet pub is a cozy spot to do so. Drop by, enjoy a couple of rounds on us, and have some fun!
