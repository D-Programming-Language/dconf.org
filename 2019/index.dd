The D Language Foundation is pleased to announce the international conference and hackathon DConf 2019 in London, United Kingdom, $(HILITE May 8 - 11 2019).

DConf is the largest gathering of D programming language enthusiasts on the planet, a face-to-face event where programmers talk shop, share and learn about their craft, find jobs, work to improve the D ecosystem, and sample the local selection of brews. Three days of presentations are followed by a fourth day of collaborative hacking on D projects, each day capped off by spirited discussion well into the night.

DConf 2019 is hosted by $(LINK2 http://symmetryinvestments.com/, our friends at Symmetry Investments). With offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, and London, Symmetry employs D in their investment management mission and previously sponsored $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/, the Symmetry Autumn of Code). We're excited to work with Symmetry in bringing DConf to London for the first time.
