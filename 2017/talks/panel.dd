BIO =
$(P $(B Andrei Alexandrescu) coined the colloquial term "modern C++" (adapted
from his award-winning book Modern C++ Design), used today to describe
a collection of important C++ styles and idioms. He is also the
coauthor (with Herb Sutter) of C++ Coding Standards and the author of
The D Programming Language book. With Walter Bright, Andrei
co-designed many important features of D and authored a large part of
D's standard library. His research on Machine Learning and Natural
Language Processing completes a broad spectrum of expertise. Andrei
holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and
a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from University "Politehnica"
Bucharest. He works with the D Language Foundation.
)

$(P $(B Walter Bright) is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation, interpreter engines and runtime libraries. Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.)

$(P $(B Scott Meyers) started programming in 1971, and he started teaching
programming in 1972. He’s best known for his $(I Effective C++) books, but
he’s also worked on constraint expression for programming languages,
program representations in development environments, software
simulations of bacteriophage lambda, general principles for improving
software quality, and the effective presentation of technical
information. In 2009, he received the Dr. Doob’s Excellence in
Programming Award, and in 2014, and online poll likened his hair style
to that of the cartoon character, He-Man.)
