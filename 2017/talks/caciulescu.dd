ABSTRACT =
$(P As with all new programming languages, one of the main
obstacles the D language faces lies with its adoption by programmers
coming from other languages. Despite it being arguably advantageous in
several aspects over classic programming languages such as C or C++,
many programmers prefer to stick with what they already know. To
narrow this gap and bring together the best of both worlds, old
and new, the D language has already the capability of calling any
functions from the C standard library. The main contribution of this
project is to extend that and provide full compatibility with the C++
standard library as well.)

$(P This talk will present the obstacles and challenges faced when
interfacing the D language with the C++ STL and provide a glimpse into
a future where D has the full support of the STL behind it.)

BIO =
$(P Alex is a Linux and security enthusiast who spends most of his time
in Sublime and vim when he isn’t slaying ‘features’ in GDB. Currently
a Masters student at University Politehnica of Bucharest, Romania,
Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, studying computer
and network security. He holds a B.Sc. in Computer Science &
Engineering. Previous experience includes low-level programming,
compilers, basic kernel and operating systems development. He first
started contributing to the Open Source community back in 2012 and has
been an active member ever since. Alex is currently working on the D
compiler and runtime environment, tackling the challenge of
interfacing D with C++.)
