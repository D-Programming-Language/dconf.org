ABSTRACT =
$(P Array operations in D have their implementation split between bits of
compiler optimized code and an archaic inheritance hierarchy in DRuntime
which relies for the most part on the TypeInfo structure.
Rather than generating from the compiler TypeInfo information and a
calls to DRuntime functions, this talk explores "lowering" array
operations to template calls in object.d. We strive to achieve a
performance improvement by removing the TypeInfo layer of indirection
and we are making a first step towards a templatized, easy to maintain
DRuntime.)
