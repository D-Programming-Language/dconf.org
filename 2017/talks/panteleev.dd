ABSTRACT =
$(P This talk covers some of the author's experience with one of D's most prominent features, meta-programming. Discussed are ways to leverage D's metaprogramming capabilities for tasks such as parsing file formats, serialization, image and video editing, game modding, and general data processing. Covered techniques include compile-time introspection, code generation, COM instrumentation, alias binding, DSLs, and general template metaprogramming. The talk also includes a few modest language improvement proposals.)
