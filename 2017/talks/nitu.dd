ABSTRACT =
$(P Since the D language has started gaining the attention of companies
and programming communities, a critical factor for the success of the
language is the existence of tools which minimize the effort of developing
programs. Such tools are: style checkers, code formatters, syntax highlighters,
auto-completion, automated refactoring etc. All these tools share the fact that
they need to access certain parts of the compiler in order to do their job.
Although the code of the compiler is open source and anyobody that wants to
build such a tool can simply extract the part of the compiler that he/she
needs, this solution is time consuming since the compiler is poorly documented
and the code complexity is rather high.)

$(P The alternative solution is to provide a D language compiler as a library. This
approach encourages tool developers by taking some work off their plate and imposes
a structure on the currently chaotic organization of the code base.)
