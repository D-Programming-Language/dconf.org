ABSTRACT =
$(P In the 45+ years since Scott Meyers wrote his first program, he’s played
many roles: programmer, user, educator, researcher, consultant.
Different roles beget different perspectives on software development,
and so many perspectives over so much time have led Scott to strong
views about $(I the things that really matter).  In this presentation,
he’ll share what he believes is especially important in software and
software development, and he’ll try to convince you to embrace the same
ideas he does.)

BIO =
$(P Scott Meyers started programming in 1971, and he started teaching
programming in 1972. He’s best known for his $(I Effective C++) books, but
he’s also worked on constraint expression for programming languages,
program representations in development environments, software
simulations of bacteriophage lambda, general principles for improving
software quality, and the effective presentation of technical
information. In 2009, he received the Dr. Dobb’s Excellence in
Programming Award, and in 2014, an online poll likened his hair style
to that of the cartoon character, He-Man.)
