ABSTRACT =
$(P In the last year, LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler, got some exciting
additions like profile guided optimization and link time optimization.
In this talk I present what the LDC team has achieved since last DConf.
A lot of development around LDC is ongoing. I show on which topics
people are currently working and give a status update on two of my pet projects:
moving more compiler source from C++ to D and addition of the
ucent data type.)
