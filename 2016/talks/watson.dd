ABSTRACT =
​Can D be used to make games? Yes. Has it been used in a major game release? It has now. Remedy Entertainment have successfully shipped the first AAA game to use D code. And it’s in a fairly critical subsystem too. This talk will cover the usage of D in Quantum Break, problems encountered and solved, and where we want to take our usage of D in the future.

$(P ​This talk will cover Remedy’s use of D in Quantum Break, providing a combination of Tools and Techniques, ​Experience Reports, ​and briefly touching on Under the Hood ​and Language Proper​topics.)
