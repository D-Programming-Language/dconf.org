ABSTRACT =
This talk gives an overview over implementing full DLL support on Windows within in the DMD reference compiler. A short description over the inner workings of Windows DLLs is given. Furthermore, the problems and possible solutions with implementing the 'export' protection level, as described in the D language specification, are explained.

$(P The talk draws from the experience of implementing a fully working version of DLLs using DMD targeting the Microsoft x64 c-runtime and linker. There are a few issues that need to be solved before a pull request can be done. These points include testing, stripping of unused symbols, better support for templates across DLL boundaries and more. All these points will be discussed during the talk.)
