ABSTRACT =
D provides support for multitasking in the form of language features and standard library modules. D makes it easy for your programs to perform multiple tasks at the same time. This kind of support is especially important in order to take advantage of the multiple CPU cores that are available on modern computing systems.

$(P Multitasking is one of the most difficult computing concepts to implement correctly. This talk will introduce different kinds of multitasking, as well as parallelism, a concept which is in fact unrelated to, but is often confused with, multitasking. The talk will conclude with fibers (aka co-routines), a powerful tool that is often overlooked despite its convenience.)

BIO =
