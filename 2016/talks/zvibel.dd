ABSTRACT =
At Weka.IO we are leveraging D for building a software based, distributed, primary storage solution. We face strict resource constraints and the systems' performance has to beat competing appliance-based solutions written in C/C++ for latency and throughput.

$(P This is the third year we’re using D, the codebase has grown to ~200k LOC, and the team to about 30 engineers - Any project of this scale starts to have issues regardless of the programming language. This talk will cover the challenges we face and lessons we’ve learned while using D. This last year we have learned to leverage the D community better, and spent quite an effort shaping our D toolchain to our needs, solving many problems that will matter to similae-scale or real-time projects when they choose to leverage D.)
