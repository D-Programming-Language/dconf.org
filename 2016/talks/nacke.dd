ABSTRACT =
Using LLVM as backend enables LDC to target many CPU architectures,
ranging from ARM and MIPS based embedded systems and smartphones over
server systems based on POWER and Sparc up to the "big iron" z System. D
everywhere seems possible!

$(P Having code generation for a target, the real work is getting druntime
and Phobos support right. This talk highlights the areas which always
needs tweaking, which are difficult to get right and which surprises you
may encounter along the way.)

$(P As the frontend of the compiler is now written in D and thus requiring a
D compiler, this talk also discusses the strategies the LDC team employs
to bootstrap the compiler code itself to a new platform.)

$(P Given the many available LLVM targets this talk inspires the audience to
bring D to their favorite platform!)
