$(P We were very very excited to hold DConf under $(HTTP sociomantic.com, Sociomantic)'s sponsorship in their neck of the woods&mdash;Berlin, one of Europe's premier technology hotbeds. Sociomantic has been a long-time supporter and user of D and we're grateful to benefit from their hosting.)

$(P The D programming language has continued to $(HTTP erdani.com/d/downloads.daily.png, grow strongly) through 2015 in both use and development participation. The fledgling D Language Foundation is poised to lead and organize the community better than ever before. DConf is the main face-to-face event for everyone and everything related to the D language and environment. The 2016 edition will be held in premiere in Europe, on the heels of strong D adoption throughout the Old Continent. We're gearing for our largest event yet!)
