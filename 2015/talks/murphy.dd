ABSTRACT =
One of the long-standing problems hindering DMD has been
that the compiler is written in C++, not D.  Over the last two years,
the DDMD project has attempted to automatically convert the majority
of DMD to D.  Where previous attempts have failed, DDMD has
successfully produced a fully functional compiler, and is on track to
replace the original C++ codebase.  This talk covers the tools and
techniques used, the problems encountered along the way, and explores
possible applications of the same approach to other projects.

$(P Content I plan to cover includes:)
$(UL
$(LI Motivation for converting the project to D.)
$(LI Evaluation of other attempts at replacing the C++ frontend such as
the original DDMD and SDC.)
$(LI How magicport (the conversion tool) works and the advantages and
disadvantages of the approach.)
$(LI Major problems faced along the way, focusing on extended C++ interop
support and C++ constructs not directly expressible in D.)
$(LI Current progress on the DDMD project and future plans (including
performance evaluation of DDMD))
$(LI Application to other projects (this will include a case study of
converting another medium-sized project if I have time))
