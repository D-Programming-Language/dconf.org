ABSTRACT =
I have developed several tools that I feel are useful for D programmers and
    would like to bring attention to how they can be used to solve problems
    facing D programmers or to speed up a typical edit-compile-run cycle.

$(P I intend to cover the following tools:)

$(UL
$(LI $(D libdparse) - A library with an up-to-date implementation of a lexer,
        parser, and AST in D for D. I will talk about its development, and how
        it has led to an increase in the quality of the official language
        specification.)
$(LI $(D generated) - A fuzz testing tool built on the grammar developed during
        the construction and debugging of libdparse. Generated has helped to
        reveal inconsistencies in libdparse, DMD, and the official language
        specification.)
$(LI $(D D-Scanner) - A D code analysis tool. It includes capabilities for code
        search and various forms of static analysis.)
$(LI    $(D Sonar) D Plugin - A plugin for the SonarQube static analysis system
        that is able to track the results of D-Scanner reports. This allows
        organizations to track code quality metrics for D in the same way that
        they would for Java, PHP, and other languages.)
$(LI $(D Harbored) - A documentation generation tool that builds on top of
        libdparse. A fork of this tool now powers ddocs.org, a site that
        aggregates documentation for artifacts published via Dub.)
$(LI $(D DCD) is an auto-completion tool for D that can be easily reused by
        text editors and IDEs. Plugins for DCD exist for Emacs, Vim, Textadept,
        Zeus, Sublime Text 3, Kate/KDevelop, DlangeIDE, IntelliJ, Coedit, and
        possibly others.)
