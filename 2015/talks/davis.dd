ABSTRACT =
Ranges are a core concept in D and its standard library,
Phobos, and understanding them is key to being able to use Phobos, as many
of its modules use them as one of their core constructs. This talk will go
over what they are, why they are, how they're used, and how to write them.

$(P This will go over all of the major input range
types and the major items that anyone using or writing ranges needs to know.
It will also definitely go into the various quirks of using strings as
ranges as well as any of the basic information on Unicode that's necessary
to understand how and why strings work they way they do. It may or may not
go into the $(D moveXXX) functions and some of the more esoteric aspects of
ranges, and it may or may not go into much detail on output ranges. It will
discuss output ranges as well.)
