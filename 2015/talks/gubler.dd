ABSTRACT =
As a student of Computer Science at UVU, the D programming language has been a breath of fresh air after learning "standard" languages used in industry like Java, C++, and C#. This experience report shows some of the places where D really shone in assignments at Utah Valley University, specifically for the virtual machine, assembler, and compiler constructed as part of UVU's Computer Science capstone track.

$(P Students at UVU are encouraged to use the language they feel the most familiar with in order to complete higher-level programming assignments. The author decided to use D as the language of choice for the series of projects that serve as the capstone for the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at UVU, which is a toolchain composed of three components:)

$(UL
$(LI A virtual machine that implements a register-register architecture, complete with static and stack-based memory.)
$(LI An assembler that targets bytecode executed by the virtual machine.)
$(LI A compiler that implements the KXI 2015 language developed at UVU, which is a very simple class-oriented language similar to C++ and D in syntax. The compiler's backend targets the assembler.)
)

$(P There are many places where D has significantly enhanced the development of these projects. Focuses in this talk will be:)

$(UL
$(LI The D module system)
$(LI Dynamic arrays and associative arrays (and the range interface, to a lesser degree))
$(LI The powerful string backend provided by D)
$(LI Templates â€“ which were a much more pleasant experience than C++)
$(LI Enums, especially in tandem with $(D std.conv.to))
$(LI Functional programming paradigm features)
$(LI Relatively small features like $(D @property))
$(LI Other minor syntax differences (UFCS))
)

BIO =
Erich Gubler is an undergraduate student, graduating this Fall with a Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science at Utah Valley University. The most relevant of his programming projects include the implementation of an academic compiler toolchain using D under the guidance of UVU faculty.
