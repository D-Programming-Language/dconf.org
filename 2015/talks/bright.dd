Walter Bright is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language
and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all
areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation,
interpreter engines and runtime libraries. Walter regularly writes articles
about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative
presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many
are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire,
which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.
