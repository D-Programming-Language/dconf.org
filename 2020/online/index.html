        <h1 class="w3-center">DConf Goes Online</h1>
        <p>
          We were all disappointed when we faced the decision to <a href="https://dconf.org/2020">cancel DConf 2020</a> in London, and we&#39;re eager to get back to meeting the D community face-to-face at future DConfs. Soon after we canceled, we began looking into how we could take DConf online as the organizers of other canceled conferences have done this year. Then we asked ourselves why we should run an online event that was simply a substitute for the offline event. Why not do something that's independent of the traditional DConf? Something that&#39;s an event unto itself. Something we can repeat in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The D Language Foundation is very pleased to announce that DConf Online 2020 (not DConf 2020 Online!) is taking place <strong>November 21 and 22, 2020</strong>. This two-day event will present a mix of pre-recorded talks and livestream events. No registration is required, no payment is necessary. It will be open to any and all who would like to participate in real time, and all talks and livestreams will persist on the D Language Foundation YouTube channel after the event concludes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&#39;ll have more to announce about DConf Online in the coming weeks. Keep an eye on this page and <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/">the official D blog</a> to stay informed so that you don&#39;t miss out on any of the events we're planning for what we hope will be the first of many DConf Online editions!

            Please send all submissions to <a href="mailto:&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#115;&#111;&#099;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#064;&#100;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> no later than <strong>August 31, 2020 AoE</strong> (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe">Anywhere on Earth</a>). We are accepting submissions for the following:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-recorded talks</strong> This is a standard conference presentation, with a speaker and slides. Presenters are required to use screen recording software (such as <a href="https://obsproject.com/">the freely available OBS</a>) to record their presentations, including slides. Speakers should be available at the day and time their talk premieres in order to answer questions in a simultaneous livestream.</li>
                <li><strong>Q & A Panels</strong> Traditional single-moderator, multiple member format. Panels will be livestreamed. Some questions may be prepared in advance, but moderators should select most questions from the livestream audience.</li>
                <li><strong>Livecoding</strong> Solitary livecoding events will be streamed to both the livecoder's personal channel (Twitch/YouTube/etc.) and the D Language Foundation's YouTube channel. Anyone submitting a livecoding session proposal should already be familiar with screen recording software and have experience streaming livecoding sessions.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            All submissions should be primarily related to the D Programming Language and, if not, relevant to the D community in some way. Livestreaming submissions (panel, livecoding) should be in Markdown format. Talk submissions should be in the form of a video no longer than five minutes in duration. All submissions should be as detailed as possible within the constraints of the requirements, which include the following:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Kind:</strong> talk/panel/livecoding</li>
              <li><strong>Duration:</strong> panels and talks should be at least 20 minutes and no longer than 60. Livecoding sessions can be alloted up to 90 minutes.</li>
              <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> beginner/intermediate/advanced/all
              <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> a brief summary of the main point/theme/coding goal.</li>
              <li><strong>Description:</strong> a more detailed summary of specific points that will be covered from beginning to end.</li>
              <li><strong>Speaker Biography:</strong> including a summary of the speaker's expertise in relation to the topic. Links to videos of any pre-recorded talks or livecoding events the speaker has done in the past, if they exist, will be very helpful.</li>
              <li><strong>DConf Exclusive (optional):</strong> pre-recorded talks that are not added to the main DConf Online schedule may be used in another playlist instead (see below). Permission is implied by submission of the video. If the speaker would like us to only consider the talk for the DConf Online schedule, then this should be indicated verbally as part of the video submission.</li>
              <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> specific terminology related to the topic.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are looking to accept more pre-recorded talk submissions than there are available slots for the DConf Online event itself. Talks that do not make the cut for the main event will be posted (with the speaker's permission) in a new &#39;The D Community Presents&#39; playlist we'll be creating after the event. To that end, we will work with every speaker we accept to produce a quality video. Further details will be provided upon acceptance.

        <h1 class="w3-center">Swag</h1>
        <p>
          Speakers at an offline DConf are elibigble to have their travel and lodging expenses reimbursed. Sadly, we can&#39;t offer any comparable reward for an online conference that is completely free, but we can offer something. Each speaker whose submission is accepted for the main event will be eligible to receive a DConf Online 2020 t-shirt and coffee mug. Those speakers whose talks are instead accepted for our new &#39;The D Community Playlist&#39; will be eligible to receive any t-shirt or coffee mug listed at <a href="https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326">the DLang Swag Emporium</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&#39;ll soon make DConf Online 2020 swag available for sale. All proceeds will be directed to the D Language Foundation General Fund, which is the fund we'll use to provide the free swag to our speakers. (<a href="https://www.flipcause.com/hosted_widget/hostedWidgetHome/NDMzMzE=">Direct donations to the General Fund</a> are welcome, too!) Keep an eye out for the announcement!
