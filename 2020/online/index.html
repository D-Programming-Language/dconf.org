        <p>
          We were all disappointed when we were faced with the decision to <a href="https://dconf.org/2020">cancel DConf 2020</a> in London, and we&#39;re eager to get back to meeting the D community face-to-face at future DConfs. Soon after we canceled, we began looking into how we could take DConf online as the organizers of other canceled conferences have done this year. Then we asked ourselves why we should run an online event that was simply a substitute for the offline event. Why not do something that's independent of the traditional DConf? Something that&#39;s an event unto itself. Something we can repeat in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://dlang.org/foundation/index.html">The D Language Foundation</a> is very pleased to announce that DConf Online 2020 (not DConf 2020 Online!) is taking place <strong>November 21 and 22, 2020</strong>. This two-day event will present a mix of pre-recorded talks and livestream sessions. No registration is required, no payment is necessary. It will be open to any and all who would like to participate in real time, and all talks and livestreams will persist on the D Language Foundation YouTube channel after the event concludes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&#39;ll have more to announce about DConf Online in the coming weeks. Keep an eye on this page and <a href="https://dlang.org/blog/">the official D blog</a> to stay informed so that you don&#39;t miss out on any of the events we're planning for what we hope will be the first of many DConf Online editions!

                <h3>Keynote: Destroy All Memory Corruption</h3>
                <p class="speaker">
                  Walter Bright<br>
                  Nov 21, 14:00 UTC
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>Memory corruption is a pernicious and expensive problem.
              Too often scrubbing it out of code requires manual review,
              which becomes increasingly impractical as the size of code
              increases. Runtime checks are inadequate because they cannot
              prove that memory corruption cannot happen since only the test
              cases are checked. The idea is to be able to detect memory
              corruption at compile time as much as possible.</p>

              <p>D has had great success at greatly reducing many common
              forms of memory corruption, such as buffer overflows, use of
              uninitialized pointers, constructing invalid pointers, and
              dangling pointers into expired stack frames.</p>

              <p>The largest remaining category of such problems is tracking
              the lifetimes of memory objects and the references to them.
              The idea is to pair every memory allocation with exactly one
              deallocation and prevent references to a memory object
              from surviving past the lifetime of that object. This presentation
              describes the design of a memory ownership and borrowing
              system suitable for inclusion into the D language, addressing
              that category.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Walter Bright is the creator and first
              implementer of the D programming language and has implemented
              compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all
              areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers,
              code generation, interpreter engines and runtime libraries.
              Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and
              programming, is known for engaging and informative
              presentations, and provides training in compiler development
              techniques. Many are surprised to discover that Walter is also
              the creator of the wargame Empire, which is still popular today
              over 30 years after its debut.</p>

                <h3>D: The Functional Programming Language Nobody is Talking About</h3>

                  Robert Schadek<br>
                  Nov 21, 15:20 UTC

              </div>
              <p>D is a functional programming language, but nobody is
              talking about it. This should change, as functional
              programming offers many advances that are easily exploited in
              D.</p>

              <p>D is a multi-paradigm programming language, and one of tho1se
              paradigms is functional programming. Even though functional
              programming is often considered to be a niche paradigm, it
              offers many advantages. These advantages are easily exploited in
              D. Unfortunately, functional programs are not bug free either,
              but D's unique combination of built-in unit tests, functional
              programming, and built-in code coverage allows many/most bugs to
              be caught early.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Robert Schadek received a master's degree
              in computer science at the University of Oldenburg. His master's
              thesis was titled &ldquo;DMCD A Distributed Multithreading
              Caching D Compiler&rdquo; and introduced multi-threading, among
              other optimizations, to the compiler control flow. He was a
              computer science PhD student from 2012&ndash;2018 at the
              University of Oldenburg. His PhD research focused on quorum
              systems in combination with graphs. Since 2018 he has been
              happily using D in his day job working for Symmetry
              Investments.</p>

              <p>DConf wouldn't be DConf, online or otherwise, without the &ldquo;Ask

              questions, and provide them with the answers they're looking

              <p>For our online version, Walter and Átila will be taking most
              questions from the livestream chat, but we'll also invite a

                  Mathias Lang<br>

                </p>
              </div>
              <p>In this talk, Mathias will share his recent work and
              future plans related to two topic that are core to D.</p>

              <p>First and foremost, parameter passing: how the current
              defaults affect us and the issues they bring. This includes the
              recently added `-preview=in`, an experimental feature that
              landed in D v2.094.0, and which attempts to redefine input
              parameters.</p>

              <p>The second part will focus on an issue that every library
              developer should be familiar with: how delegates and attributes
              are often at odds, and how writing good library code to support
              them is not currently possible. Finally, Mathias will show
              how a simple language addition could help solve this
              problem.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Mathias Lang started his journey with D
              in 2012 while looking for a language which could quench his
              metaprogramming thirst. After a few years at Sociomantic Labs,
              he is now CTO for <a
              href="https://bosagora.io">https://bosagora.io</a>, developing a
              blockchain project in D.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Átila Neves has a PhD in Particle Physics
              for research done at CERN. Most of the time spent there required
              programming in C++, with a two-year stint as a Perl programmer
              on the IT department's security team. He also worked for Cisco
              for almost seven years, developing networking software in C and
              C++ and leading his teams in the areas of software quality and
              testing. He now works as a D consultant/programmer for Symmetry
              Investments, as well as being the deputy maintainer of the D
              programming language. He spends his spare time yelling at the
              screen in frustration while waiting for computers to compile his
              code.</p>

              sucks, generic transformers (functions that take internal data
              types and yield a simpler data type that can be chained), and a

              <p>This talk will demonstrate a method of exposing a D library
              through a C API and give an example of using the library from
              Python.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Ali is a software engineer with
              programming language experiences mostly in C, C++, and D. His
              past work includes a fun stint at WekaIO, a high performance
              storage company that bases its technology entirely on D. Ali is
              the author of the book Programming in D, the secretary and board

              </div>
              <p>This is a talk for all D coders who care about
              <code>@safe</code> and
              <code>@trusted</code> code (which should be all D coders!).
              Steve will go over memory safety and how D's related attributes
              can be used, with a focus on the interaction between
              <code>@safe</code> and <code>@trusted</code>. It's actually easy
              to write code that's tagged <code>@safe</code> that isn't
              actually memory safe, thanks to the possibility that
              <code>@safe</code> and
              <code>@trusted</code> code can be written with different
              semantic expectations on the same data. Steve will dig into this
              through the example of a tagged union implementation.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Steven Schveighoffer has been to every
              real-world DConf since 2013 and has presented at four of them.
              He has published an article on the D Blog about writing @trusted
              code, migrated a very unsafe, complex codebase to be @safe, and
              worked on fixing @trusted issues in Phobos (D's standard
              library) and DRuntime.</p>

                <h3>Faster Compile Times: Approaching Zero Template Overhead</h3>

              </div>
              <p>The D programming language offers a plethora of compile-time
              features which allow for metaprogramming and code generation,
              and which have seen increased usage over time. As a side effect, D
              programmers who use these features have found themselves facing
              increased compile times.</p>

              <p>In this talk, Stefan will dig into DMD's internals to provide
              context on this phenomenon. Through code examples, he'll show
              what can cause increased compile times and how to make them
              faster. He'll preview work that's currently being done to
              improve the situation and discuss future directions.</p>

              <p class="bio w3-card">Stefan has been programming in D
              personally and professionally since 2013. He has taken a special
              interest in the performance of D’s compile-time features and has
              been contibuting to DMD for over four years. He has presented
              either a full talk or a lightning talk at three DConfs and is
              currently employed as a D programmer by Symmetry
              Investments.</p>

            <p>At every real-world DConf, a location near the venue is selected
            and annointed as the Official After-Hours Gathering Spot. After the

            chatting, and just generally having a good time.

            href="https://dlang.org/blog/2017/04/19/the-dconf-experience/">Ethan
            Watson coined the term &ldquo;BeerConf&rdquo;</a> to refer to this
            event, and the name has stuck&mdash;so much so that he and other
            members of the D community <a
            href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/krtvrgubmqbnnrequmtq@forum.dlang.org">initiated
            an online BeerConf</a> after DConf 2020 was canceled due to the
            coronavirus pandemic. That one-off event was a hit, and it has been
            running once a month ever since.</p>

            <p>DConf Online is still DConf, so there still must be a BeerConf.
            And since it's online, we can run it all weekend! The virtual
            BeerConf space will be open from the evening (UTC) of Friday,
            November 20 (the specific time will be announced in advance) and
            will be continuously open all weekend to anyone who wants to join.
            Despite the name, no alcohol is required to participate. As long as
            you have a connected device, a web browser, a microphone, and an
            optional webcam, you're invited to come on in and participate in
            this annual DConf tradition.</p>
