HACKATHON_ABSTRACT=
$(P
The D conference will not end after the three days of talks, but will continue into a fourth day for our 2nd annual Hackathon!
Collaborate with fellow D hackers to make the D community a better place.)

$(P
The first DConf Hackathon resulted in, to quote Walter Bright, "A tsunami of pull requests". From working on core D features like the initial immplementation of static foreach and the splitting up of std.datetime into multiple modules, to hacking on third-party projects like iopipe and dub, people worked alone or in groups to fix bugs and implement improvements. Others hashed out ideas, like the group that focused on bringing D to the GPU. Still others took their time to act as tutors, helping fellow D hackers improve their D skillset.

$(P
This year we aim to repeat our success. We hope you stick around to participate in this final day of DConf and see where the day takes you!
