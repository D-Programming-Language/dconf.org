$(P
Razvan Nitu has been taking part in the development effort of the D compiler for one and a half years.

The talk will delve into the struggles of a rookie compiler developer trying to leave his mark and make D a better language for everyone. Key aspects of the development process will be exposed via an overview of the most important projects that the author has worked on:  D language compiler as a library, lambda comparison, and postblit qualifier paradox. If you have ever wondered about the perks of being a compiler contributor then this is the talk for you.
