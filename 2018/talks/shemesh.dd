$(P
Shachar (that's me) has been a programmer for over 3 decades. His experience includes heading Check Point's security response team, being a core developer on LiveU's video streaming device, and helping porting Akamai's code into a more modern software architecture. In between, Shachar has also worked on several open source projects, authoring such joys as rsyncrypto and fakeroot-ng, as well as such abominations as sshpass. Shachar even has credit for a one-liner in the vanilla Linux kernel, which still officially makes him a "Linux kernel contributer".)

$(P
For the past 3Â½ years Shachar has been a D programmer at Weka.io, first writing its RAID subsystem, and recently fully engaged with the Mecca effort.
