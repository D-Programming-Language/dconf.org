ABSTRACT =
$(P
There has been increasing interest in using static introspection as an enabling technology in the D language. However, the primitives provided - some built-in, some available in library form - could be organized more systematically to allow simple, natural use that can be immediately understood and easily maintained. This talk is a vision of an integrated library-based approach to static introspection that makes short work of some traditional challenges, and more importantly enables new, complex uses.

BIO =
$(P Andrei Alexandrescu coined the colloquial term "modern C++" (adapted from his award-winning book Modern C++ Design), used today to describe a collection of important C++ styles and idioms. He is also the coauthor (with Herb Sutter) of C++ Coding Standards and the author of The D Programming Language book. With Walter Bright, Andrei co-designed many important features of D and authored a large part of D's standard library. His research on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing completes a broad spectrum of expertise. Andrei holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from University "Politehnica" Bucharest. He works with the D Language Foundation.
