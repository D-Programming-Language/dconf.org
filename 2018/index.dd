$(T h1,,DConf 2018$(BR) in Munich!)

$(P
The D Language Foundation is pleased to announce the international conference and hackathon DConf 2018 in Munich, Germany, May 2-5 2018.

$(P
DConf is the main face-to-face event for everyone in the D programming language community and anyone who wants to know what all the fuss is about. We are proud to be hosted in Munich, a hotbed of systems and embedded software with a strong and vibrant programmer community. And if you use the public transportation system, beware! The passenger information software is written in D by local company Funkwerk AG.

$(P
We are featuring growth and outreach as a special theme this year - if you have any friends who use another language who could benefit from learning more about the D language, let them know!
