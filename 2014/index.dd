$(T h1,,DConf 2014 Call for Submissions)

$(T h2,,Please join us at DConf 2014, the conference of the D programming language (Menlo Park, CA, May 21-23 2014).)

$(P These are heady days for the D programming language. Since $(LINK2 ../2013/,
last year's conference) we've witnessed a growing user base, accelerated
participation to core development, and stronger corporate support. Quality and
stability have improved all across the board for $(LINK2 http://github.com/D
-Programming-Language/dmd, dmd), $(LINK2 http://gdcproject.org, gdc), $(LINK2
https://github.com/ldc-developers, ldc), and the $(LINK2 http://github.com/D
-Programming-Language/phobos, standard library).)

$(P DConf is the main face-to-face event for everyone and everything related to
the D language and environment. Facebook will host the conference for the second consecutive year at its headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. We aim at making this next edition even bigger, better, and badder than DConf 2013!
)

$(T h2,,Call for Submissions)

$(P We are looking forward to your submission for a paper, talk, demo, or panel for DConf 2014. The topics of choice are anything and everything related to the D language. Such include:)

$(T ul,,
$(LI $(B Language Proper) issues, such as new idioms and techniques enabled by D)

$(LI $(B Tools and Techniques) for maximizing productivity when
working in D)

$(LI $(B Experience reports) on using D in the real world)

$(LI $(B Under the hood) looks at compiler and standard library implementation artifacts)

$(LI $(B Hot topics) that are sure to engender lively debates, such
as manual and automatic memory management, migrating from other
languages, and of course the perennial matter of managing the D development itself
)
)

$(P But don't be constrained! Originality in topics and formats is warmly encouraged. If it is relevant to the D language, it fits. Just mind the guidelines and don't forget the deadlines below.)

$(P Speakers will receive a free conference registration and will have
reasonable travel costs covered. Speakers who pay for registration and
subsequently get an approved submission will have registration costs reimbursed.)

$(P DConf 2014 does not accept presentation proposals that are advertisements of for-sale products or technologies. Vendors interested in doing so, please $(LINK2 contact.html, contact) us for sponsorship information. We appreciate your understanding.)

$(P We expect original work, or work synthesized from community folklore into interesting tidbits by the author. Related work can be mentioned with credit. Overviews of an area covered by other authors is acceptable, again with due credit and assuming the overview has intrinsic value.)

$(T h2,,Selection Criteria)

The committee will review and rate submissions according to the following criteria:

$(T ul,,

$(LI $(B Relevance:) Is the topic interesting to DConf attendees? Will a coverage be beneficial? Is it building on tried and true ideas, or on the contrary, blazing new trails?)

$(LI $(B Coverage:) Does the proposal cover the topic in depth? What are the main insights dispensed by the submission?)

$(LI $(B Organization:) Is the submission well organized? Will the audience tune into the narrative?)

$(LI $(B Novelty and Originality:) How new and noteworthy is the material? Previously published material is acceptable provided it hasn't reached a wide audience within the D community yet.)

$(LI $(B Credentials:) What qualifies you to talk on the topic of choice? Although this criterion favors experienced and well-known submitters, we also very strongly encourage submissions from up-and-coming contributors who have accumulated "street cred" through their open source and forum contributions.)

$(LI $(B Bottom line:) What's your session's takeaway? How is it going to improve attendees' knowledge, outlook, and inspiration?)
)

$(T h2,,Submission Guidelines)

$(P We expect submission in plain text format or one of the usual rich document formats, such as PDF or DOC. Send your submissions to $(LINK2 mailto:dconf2014@digitalmars.com, dconf2014@digitalmars.com). The submission should include:)
