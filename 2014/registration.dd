$(T h1,, Registration)

$(P Pre-registration is now open!)

$(P Are you cost-conscious? Do you trust the conference will have a great
program even before seeing the program? Then pre-register before the submission
process has ended $(B for only $(DOLLAR)250) to get the full conference package!)

$(P Pre-registration must be completed on or before January 31, 2014, same as
the deadline for proposal submissions. Prices go up to $(DOLLAR)400 (early bird)
and then $(DOLLAR)425 (sticker price). Pre-register as soon
as possible to reserve your seat for less&mdash;a savings of over 40%!)
