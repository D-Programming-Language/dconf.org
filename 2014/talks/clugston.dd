TALK_TITLE = Real-Time Big Data in D

LEVEL = Intermediate

BENEFITS =
In one sentence: D should consider Big Data as one of its key markets, so we
should be ruthless about memory inefficiency.

$(T OL,,
$(T LI,, An introduction to Big Data, why it is important, and how it differs from traditional high-performance code.)

ABSTRACT =
"Big Data" applications, which process petabytes of data per year, are
computationally demanding, yet they have different requirements from
traditional performance-critical applications. A programming language which
is well suited for CPU-bound code, isn't necessarily ideal for real-time Big
Data.

$(P At Sociomantic Labs, we consume a deluge of real time data every day using
an all-D technology stack. This talk will explain how our use of D has been
successful in our intensely competitive industry.
Unfortunately, most existing D libraries were not designed for Big Data
applications. I'll discuss the performance killers they contain,
and propose some changes to make D the natural choice for Big Data tasks.)

BIO =
Don is a Senior Software Developer at Sociomantic Labs, Berlin.
He has contributed to the D language since 2005, mainly in the areas
of mathematics and metaprogramming. Before joining Sociomantic as
a full-time D programmer, he worked in the solar photovoltaic industry
on numerical modelling, measurement, and industrial inkjet. His
'FastDelegate' library is well known in the C++ community.
He has two sons, and a daughter with superpowers.
