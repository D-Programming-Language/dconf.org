BENEFITS =
The first part and main focus of this talk will be DustMite, the D source code
minimization tool. Although the tool has already found popularity amongst many D
users and developers,   it remains difficult and initially unintuitive to get
started with.   The talk will cover an extensive tutorial of its usage, starting
with basic use, following into more advanced use cases,   such as effective
reduction of compiler regressions, stalls, crashes,   and dealing with false
reductions, and later covering some   unusual applications of DustMite.

$(P Following DustMite will be a description of Digger, a tool
which interfaces with Git and its "bisect" functionality, and
allows to quickly determine the change which introduced a
regression.)

$(P Finalizing the talk will be descriptions of several tools to solve problems
such as large binary size, slow compilation time, and possibly large memory
consumption.)

ABSTRACT =
This talk confronts some of the challenges encountered by D users and
developers, such as narrowing down implementation bugs and other problems
difficult to diagnose conventionally. Topics covered include DustMite, the
source code minimization tool, Git and its use in D development, as well as a
miscellanea of other tools of related purpose.

BIO =
I am Vladimir Panteleev, a D enthusiast from Moldova (Eastern Europe).   I am
known in the D community for authoring DFeed ($(LINK http://forum.dlang.org)),
DustMite, and several other tools,   some of which will be covered in this talk.
