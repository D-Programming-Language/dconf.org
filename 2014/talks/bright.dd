ABSTRACT =
Memory safety, powerful abstractions, and fast compilation are great features
to have. But what about high performance code? This talk shows how D can deliver
on generating highly competitive, no-compromise performance applications.
Conventional wisdom says that high performance and powerful abstractions are
in conflict with each other, that one must write close-to-the-metal code to get
high performance. Bright will show that this is no longer true with a modern
high level language like D.

BENEFITS =
This talk will provide insight into how to combine D's capabilities to generate
high performance code, and why it works. It'll be practical and transferrable
to solving everyday performance problems. Amaze your colleagues by smoking their
solutions written in other languages.

BIO =
Walter Bright is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language
and has implemented compilers for several other languages. He's an expert in all
areas of compiler technology, including front ends, optimizers, code generation,
interpreter engines and runtime libraries. Walter regularly writes articles
about compilers and programming, is known for engaging and informative
presentations, and provides training in compiler development techniques. Many
are surprised to discover that Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire,
which is still popular today over 30 years after its debut.
