TALK_TITLE = Refactoring JIT Compilation

LEVEL = Intermediate

BENEFITS =
Exposure to the world of JIT compilers and dynamic language optimization.
Discussion of a novel compiler architecture which is at the intersection of
method-based compilation and tracing, aiming to combine the advantages of both.
A demonstration of how various features of D can help simplify and clean up the
implementation of complex systems software in practice.

ABSTRACT =
Higgs, a JIT compiler for JavaScript written in D, was presented at DConf 2013.
Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of
testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring
how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of
benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results
to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler
architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining.
We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more
in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in
the Higgs implementation.

BIO =
Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert is the creator of Higgs, an experimental JIT compiler
for JavaScript written in D. She holds a master's degree from McGill University
and is currently pursuing a PhD at Université de Montréal as part of the
Dynamic Language Team. Her area of study is compiler design and optimization,
with a focus on dynamic programming languages, JIT compilers and type analysis.
